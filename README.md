In order for the chat to work, you will need a local network emulator, for example: Radmin VPN and in the code itself, change a couple of lines to your IP and any port you need, after which you will be able to register in the chat from any browser and communicate with everyone who has entered it. Example address: http://26.110.7.44:1488
